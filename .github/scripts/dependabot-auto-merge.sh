# update fail - and merges it when the whole check suite is green.
#
# IT IS A SCRIPT RATHER THAN INLINE YAML BECAUSE IT HAS TWO CALLERS, and they exist for different
# reasons. `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` runs it on a CI completion, which is the fast path, and again
# on a schedule, which is the only path that CONVERGES: a pull request whose checks finished before
# this workflow existed - or while it was disabled, or during a runner outage - will never receive
# another `workflow_run`. An automation that can only act on an event it happened to catch is not
# one that runs on its own.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED ON THE AUTHOR, HERE rather than in either caller: a guard written once in the place
# that does the merging cannot be bypassed by adding a third trigger later.
#
# Usage: dependabot-auto-merge.sh <pr-number>
# Prints `MERGED <pr>` on stdout when it merged, so the caller can dispatch ONE deploy for a sweep
# that merged several. Never exits non-zero for a pull request it declines to touch: a sweep must
# not be stopped by one unmergeable branch.
