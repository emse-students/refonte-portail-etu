# Install oxvelte, the Svelte template linter, at the ONE revision this project lints against.
# Called by scripts/run-oxvelte.sh, which is how anything here reaches oxvelte.
#
# POSIX sh, not bash: `package.json` invokes these through `sh`, and on the CI runner `sh` is dash.
# `set -o pipefail` and `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` are bash-only and would fail there and only there.
#
# The revision is PINNED. `cargo install --git` with no `--rev` tracks the default branch, so two
# machines that ran the same command on different days hold different linters and disagree about
# the same file - a gate whose verdict depends on when somebody last installed it. oxvelte publishes
# no tag past v0.1.2 and nothing on npm, so a commit sha is the only name this version has.
#
# No minimum-Rust check lives here. oxvelte declares no `rust-version`, so any number in this file
# would be a guess - and the guess that used to be here refused an install that then worked on the
# toolchain it had just rejected. A build failure names the real requirement.
